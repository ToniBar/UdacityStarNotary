Truffle v5.1.17
OpenZeppelin 2.5.0

Token Name: Star Token
Token Symbol: ST

Token Address on Ropsten network: 0x513D9Ae56C70c3B10E6c56a4f4bd30c1E0b65843

Remarks:
* I used the Ropsten network because on the Rinkeby Network I needed to use Facebook or Twitter to get ETH. I don't have a Facebook or a twitter account.
* I removed the mnemonic and the infuria codes from my truffle config file. But you can see in the Ropsten network that I created several stars on the address, so it proves that I know 
  how to set this properly. I replaced these codes with question marks.
